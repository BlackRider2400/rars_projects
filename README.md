# RARS Assembly Projects

## Overview

This repository contains several RISC-V assembly projects developed for use with the **RARS (RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator)** environment. The primary focus is the `projekt.asm` file, demonstrating the ellipse-drawing algorithm using Bresenham's method.

## ðŸŒŸ **projekt.asm** (Ellipse Drawing with Bresenham's Algorithm)

### Description
`projekt.asm` implements the Bresenham Ellipse Drawing Algorithm, a highly efficient method for drawing ellipses. The algorithm uses integer arithmetic to determine pixel positions, optimizing rendering performance by avoiding floating-point calculations.

### Key Features:
- Implements Bresenham's algorithm for ellipse generation entirely in assembly.
- Produces a valid bitmap image file (`testout14.bmp`) containing the drawn ellipse.
- Manages the creation of bitmap headers (`BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER`) to ensure compatibility with standard image viewers.
- Offers practical insight into low-level pixel manipulation techniques in assembly language.

### How to Run `projekt.asm`

1. **Download RARS:**
   Obtain the latest RARS release from the [official repository](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars).

2. **Open `projekt.asm`:**
   - Launch RARS:
     ```bash
     java -jar RARS.jar
     ```
   - Load `projekt.asm` from the repository directory.
   - Assemble and run the program.

3. **View Generated Image:**
   The generated image (`testout14.bmp`) will be saved in the repository's directory and can be viewed using any standard image viewer.
